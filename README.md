This is an application finished by myself, through the very first period of my working in Obisoft. However, due to some causes of lacking money and experience of distributing our product, this app was terminated from going to the App Store.

After some periods of struggling, the origin server of the app has been expired in December 2015, which means that the app would be no longer supported.

On April 18, the new version of NEU School Network came up, leading to the failure of the only function it deserves: School Network sign in. Till then, it has been totally deprecated.

So today I choose to open-source it, though there won't be much effect of that. Since the app has been deprecated, there may be compiling error of the project.
